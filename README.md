# HR Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of HR data using Tableau to uncover key insights related to employee attrition, promotion trends, income distribution, overtime work, and job satisfaction. The insights derived from the data can assist HR departments in making informed decisions to improve employee retention, satisfaction, and overall company performance.

## Dashboard Description

The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the following key aspects:

1. **Attrition by Department:**
   - This bar chart shows the count of employee attrition across different departments. It's evident that the Research & Development department experiences the highest attrition rate, while Human Resources has the lowest.

2. **Years at Company vs. Promotion:**
   - A line chart representing the number of years employees spend at the company before receiving a promotion. The data shows varying trends, with significant promotion spikes at certain tenure milestones.

3. **Distribution of Monthly Income by Age Group:**
   - This box plot illustrates how monthly income is distributed across different age groups. The plot helps to identify outliers and the central tendency of income within each age group.

4. **Balancing Act: How Overtime Affects Job Satisfaction:**
   - A heat map that explores the relationship between overtime and job satisfaction. This visualization helps in understanding how working extra hours might correlate with employee satisfaction levels.

5. **Distribution of Overtime Rates Among Employees:**
   - A bar chart comparing the count of employees who work overtime versus those who do not. The chart provides a clear distribution of overtime engagement across the workforce.

## Key Insights

- **High Attrition in R&D**: The Research & Development department has a noticeably higher attrition rate compared to other departments. This may indicate the need for further investigation into job satisfaction and working conditions within this department.
  
- **Promotion Trends**: There are significant spikes in promotions at certain years of service, particularly after 10 and 20 years, suggesting that long-term employees are more likely to be promoted during these periods.

- **Income Disparities**: The distribution of income across age groups shows that while most employees fall within a typical income range, there are notable outliers that may require further analysis to understand any disparities.

- **Overtime and Job Satisfaction**: The heat map highlights potential correlations between overtime work and job satisfaction. Understanding these patterns can help in designing better work-life balance initiatives.

- **Overtime Distribution**: The majority of employees do not engage in overtime work, but for those who do, it is crucial to monitor the impact on their job satisfaction and overall productivity.

## Usage

This dashboard can be used by HR professionals and managers to:

- Monitor and reduce attrition rates by identifying problem areas.
- Understand promotion patterns and develop fair promotion practices.
