# HR Analytics Dashboard
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing HR data using Tableau to uncover key insights related to employee performance, department-specific trends, and gender distribution. These insights can help HR departments make informed decisions regarding promotions, gender balance, and overall employee performance.

## Dashboard Description

The HR Analytics Dashboard provides an in-depth view of the following key aspects:

1. **Employee Performance by Department and Job Role**:
   - This stacked bar chart visualizes the performance ratings of employees across various departments and job roles, broken down by gender. It highlights the differences in performance between males and females in each role within departments like Research & Development, Sales, and Human Resources.

## Key Insights

- **Gender Performance Differences**: The visualization clearly shows that there are notable differences in performance between male and female employees in different job roles. For instance, in Research & Development, male employees tend to have higher performance ratings compared to their female counterparts, whereas in other departments like Sales, the distribution is more balanced.

- **Performance Trends in Key Roles**: Research Scientists and Sales Executives stand out with the highest overall performance ratings across both genders, indicating a strong performance trend in these roles. However, further analysis might be needed to explore the factors driving these high-performance ratings.

## Usage

This dashboard can be used by HR professionals and managers to:

- **Monitor Gender Balance**: Track the performance of employees by gender in various departments to ensure gender equality in performance recognition and promotions.
- **Enhance Department-Specific Strategies**: Identify areas where performance differences exist and develop strategies to support underperforming employees based on department and role.
