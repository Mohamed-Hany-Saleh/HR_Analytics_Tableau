# HR Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of HR data using Tableau to uncover key insights related to employee attrition, performance, income distribution, and overtime work. These insights are aimed at assisting HR departments in making informed decisions to enhance employee retention, satisfaction, and performance.

## Dashboard Description

The HR Analytics Dashboard offers a detailed look at the following key aspects:

1. **Attrition by Department**:
   - This bar chart displays the count of employee attrition in different departments. It highlights that the Research & Development department has the highest attrition rate, while Human Resources experiences the lowest.

2. **Performance Distribution by Gender Across Different Departments**:
   - A stacked bar chart that visualizes performance ratings across departments (Human Resources, Research & Development, and Sales) and job roles. It shows the performance distribution between male and female employees, revealing any gender-related trends in performance.

3. **Distribution of Monthly Income by Age Group**:
   - This horizontal bar chart depicts how monthly income is distributed across various age groups. It allows for the identification of income trends among different age demographics.

4. **Balancing Act: How Overtime Affects Job Satisfaction**:
   - A pie chart visualizing the division of employees working overtime versus those who do not. This chart provides insights into the potential effects of overtime work on employee satisfaction.

5. **Distribution of Overtime Rates Among Employees**:
   - A bar chart illustrating the count of employees who work overtime versus those who donâ€™t. This provides a clear view of the proportion of the workforce engaged in overtime.

## Key Insights

- **High Attrition in R&D**: The Research & Development department experiences a higher rate of attrition compared to other departments, suggesting a need for further investigation into employee satisfaction and workload.
  
- **Gender-Based Performance Trends**: Performance ratings show that, in most departments, male and female employees perform similarly, though specific roles like Research Scientist and Sales Executive show distinct differences in performance between genders.

- **Income Distribution by Age**: Income distribution shows that older employees (46-55 and 55+) generally have higher monthly incomes, which is likely due to their increased experience and tenure.

- **Overtime and Satisfaction**: The pie chart demonstrates that most employees (1,062) do not work overtime, while a smaller group (418) does. Understanding how overtime impacts job satisfaction and overall performance is critical for HR strategies.

## Usage

- Monitor attrition rates and investigate underlying causes in specific departments.
